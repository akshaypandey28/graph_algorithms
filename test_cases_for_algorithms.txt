V : number of nodes in the graph
E : number of edges in the graph
edges : u v weight (distance between u and v is weight)

Dijkstra algorithm
V=5
E=5
edges are
0 1 4
0 2 8
1 4 6
2 3 2
3 4 10

src=0
answer from source node to each node = 0 4 8 10 10 

V=7
E=9

answer from source node to each node = 0 1 4 2 3 5 4




Prims algorithm
V=5
E=6
edges are
0 1 3
